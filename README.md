# Attractiveness and Criminal Sentencing
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the attractiveness of felons and
criminal sentencing. If you agree to participate in this experiment, more detailed instructions will be provided later
on in the study.

In this study, you will be shown pictures of convicted felons across Florida, USA. These felons have
been found guilty, are convicted and currently are serving time in correction facilities. You will be tasked with
assessing the appearance of randomly selected felons through their mugshots through several simple survey questions.
Your responses to the survey will be anonymous.
